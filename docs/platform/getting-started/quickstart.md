# Quick Start

mmesh is an innovative overlay network build for the cloud. It lets you easily create your virtual network to integrate your on-prem and multi-cloud environments in minutes.

Get started with the following steps to create your own virtual private network:

## 1. Create your account

Follow these [instructions](account.md#create-a-new-account) to create your account.

An initial or default [network](topology.md#network) and [subnet](topology.md#subnet) are automatically created in `default` [tenant](topology.md#tenant) with the information provided in account setup.

## 2. Add your nodes

A first node will be automatically created as part of the account creation process. Once a node is created on the webUI, follow the provided instructions to install mmesh on it.

To create more nodes, select the subnet where you want to add them and click on the `Add Node` button.



## What's next?

By completing this guide you have your mmesh up and running and are ready to explore the features of mmesh:

- [Install mmeshctl](cli-install.md), our mmesh command line interface.
- Integrate your Kubernetes [services](k8s-services.md) and [workloads](k8s-pods.md).
- Manage your traffic with [security polices](network-security.md#security-policies).
- Manage your automation with [workflows](workflow.md).
- And [more](features.md)
