# Quick Start

mmesh is an innovative network, monitoring and automation platform that lets you easily create your virtual topology to integrate your on-prem and multi-cloud environments in minutes.

Get started with the following steps:

## 1. Create your account

You can find the guide [here](/docs/platform/administration/account/) 

## 2. Add your nodes

Use the `Add Node` button on the app webUI to connect nodes to your default subnet. Go to your node and follow instructions to install mmesh on it.

## 3. Install and configure mmeshctl

1. Download and install the `mmeshctl` binary. Linux, macOS and Windows binary downloads are available from the [Releases](https://github.com/mmesh/m-cli/releases) page at the mmesh-cli [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmesh/m-cli).
2. Execute `mmeshctl setup` to generate your `mmeshctl.yml`. This config file will be located by default in the `$HOME/.mmesh` directory.

Find more details in the [mmeshctl installation guide](/docs/platform/installation/cli/).

## Next Steps

By completing this guide you have your mmesh up and running and are ready to explore all the features of mmesh:

- Integrate your Kubernetes Services and Pods with `mmeshctl k8s`.
- Manage your traffic security rules with `mmeshctl policy`.
- Manage your automation workflows with `mmeshctl ops workflow`.
- Check the alerts of your nodes with `mmeshctl alert list`.
- Connect to your nodes with `mmeshctl exec`.
