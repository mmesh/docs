3. Press the `Continue` button and open your email to get your one-time code similar to this:

    Please, provide the required information in the following sections:

    - **Billing Information**
    - **Account Configuration**
        - For `Control Plane Location` field, we suggest picking up a zone from the list that is geographically near to your network devices.
        - For `Connectivity Zone` field, the same suggestion made for `Control Plane Location` apply.
    - **Admin credentials**
    - **Initial Topology**
        - An initial or default network and subnet will be also created, so just provide the CIDR for your `default network` and define the first `subnet` of your election or just accept the defaults provided.

6. Finally, push the `start` button and you will be logged into the **mmesh** dashboard.
