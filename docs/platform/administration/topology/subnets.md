# Subnets Administration

A mmesh `subnet` is a logical component of mmesh that groups `nodes`.

> See [Topology](/docs/platform/networking/topology/#subnet) section to find more information on mmesh subnets.

## Attributes

The following table includes the attributes that define a mmesh `subnet`:

| Name             | Type      | Default | Editable<sup>*</sup> | Description |
| :--------------- | :-------: | :-----: | :------------------: | :---------- |
| `subnetCIDR`    | `string`  |         | no  | /24 IPv4 prefix within the parent network range|
| `subnetID`       | `string`  | `subnet-nnn` | no  | subnet identifier derived from `subnetCIDR` (could also appear as `vrfID`) |
| `description`    | `string`  |         | yes | short descriptive text |
| `subnet_secret` | `string` | | yes | subnet authorization secret |
| `default_security_policy` | `enum` | | yes | default security policy: `ACCEPT` \| `DROP` |

<table-note>
The parameter can be modified once the entity is created.
