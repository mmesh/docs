# Automation

You can use mmesh as your automation engine and scheduler for your infrastructure.

In mmesh we have the capability to execute your workflows automatically on any mmesh-node. Not only this, our Workflows application page provides a single point of control for all your workflows, no matter where they are executed.

### :material-page-next: [Projects](projects.md)

Use [projects](projects.md) to organize workflows. Create different projects depending on your organization, either by department, environment, or any organizative unit that requires to control their automations.

### :material-page-next: [Workflows](workflows.md)

The automation subsystem of mmesh is based on [workflows](workflows.md). Any workflow contains a set of tasks with a defined schedule. Workflows are configured using declarative YAML files that you can easily manage via GitOps to define and schedule tasks.
