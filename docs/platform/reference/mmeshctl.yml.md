# Command Line Tool Configuration Reference

If you run `mmeshctl` for the first time or the file `mmeshctl.yml` is not found under your `$HOME/.mmesh` directory, you will be asked to enter your mmesh accountID and credentials, and a new configuration file will be generated and saved in `$HOME/.mmesh`.

The generated file does not include the `agent` section (see below) where you can specify the extended security credentials to get access to your nodes. Although they are recommended, this section is optional.

> See [Nodes Remote Management Features](nodes.md#remote-management-features) for more information about mmesh remote management and extended security credentials.
