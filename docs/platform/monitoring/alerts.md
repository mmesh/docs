# Alert Integration

mmesh monitors the nodes and generates alerts when it detects a node is unhealthy. Integrations with PagerDuty and Slack are supported.

### PagerDuty

The PagerDuty integration allows you to forward all the alerts of your mmesh to your PagerDuty account.

mmesh highly recommends the PagerDuty service and configuring this integration to take full advantage of the mmesh alert system.

### Slack

You can also configure a Slack webhook for mmesh to notify you when an alert has been triggered.
